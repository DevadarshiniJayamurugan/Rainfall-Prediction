# Rainfall-Prediction

Heyy People,

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict rainfall, showcasing the importance of data preprocessing, handling imbalances, and comparing model performance.

Pros
- Multiple Models: Comparison of different models provides insights into which algorithm performs best.
- Handling Imbalance: Using oversampling techniques addresses class imbalance, which is common in real-world datasets.
- Feature Scaling: Standardizing features can lead to faster convergence and better model performance.

Cons
- Limited Data Size: Small datasets may lead to overfitting, impacting model generalization.
- Model Complexity: Some models like XGBoost can be complex and require tuning of many hyperparameters.
- Data Assumptions: Assumes that filling missing values with the mean is appropriate, which might not always be the case.

I have uploaded all the necessary documents for this project :
- Python Code
- Dataset

And do ensure that you have these libraries installed beforehand in your System:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- imbalanced-learn

Steps to use the code:

1. Download the zip file
2. Extract the file
3. Install the required libraries
4. Open the main.py file
5. Save the python file and run it 
6. You will have your output.

Have a Nice Day!!
